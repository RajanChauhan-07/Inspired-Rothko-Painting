# Inspired-Rothko-Painting
I do wanted to maked an Rothko Painting just like the one in the freecodecamp course. Instead made something else, while playing with boxes and adjusting their layouts i.e margin, padding, transformation etc.
It was fun, Previously it used to take me 10+ hours to design and code something like this but now it just took probably 4 hours .
I would'nt call it painting as it's just looks like a desktop setup on a table with a really nice pink accent.
